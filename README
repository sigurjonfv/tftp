### Implementation Details ###
* Using TFTP we have written a simple file transfer server.
* To make sure we are not accessing unauthorized files (files outside the given directory) we resolved the directory path and the filepath and make sure the directory path is a prefix of the file path.
* We deny write requests since this server does not allow uploads.
* An erroneous request results in writing out the error and terminating the request, making the server ready for a new request.
* A request that does not have op_code 1 or 2 we reply with illegal_op_error.
* If we receive an error from recvfrom function we just terminate the server because we can't be sure what's going on.
